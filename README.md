# REDCap Warning Banner

This REDCap External Module allows administrators to display a warning banner to survey respondents, and users on the invite participants page, if the project is of purpose 'Practice', or otherwise, is still in development mode.

## Installation

Install the module from the REDCap module repository and enable in the Control Center, then enable on all projects.

## Usage

Administrators may configure the module to display a warning on practice/just for fun projects, and/or a warning on projects that are not in production mode. They may also configure the warning text that is displayed for each.

Administrators may also override this on a per-project level, either disabling the warnings or replacing the warning text.

## TODO

- Allow configuration options to modify the banner style, or select from several templates.
